# SkinSkan
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for early detection of skin cancer using deep learning techniques. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on dermoscopic images to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant. The system leverages image preprocessing and data augmentation to improve model robustness and accuracy. Publicly available datasets, such as the ISIC archive, are used to train and validate the model. The primary goal is to assist medical professionals by providing an accurate, fast, and non-invasive diagnostic tool that can support early diagnosis and treatment, especially in remote or resource-limited settings.
